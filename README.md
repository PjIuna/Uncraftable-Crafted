# Uncraftable Crafted

Make uncraftable items craftable!

## Description

Uncraftable Crafted lets you craft items that are normally impossible to craft in vanilla Minecraft. It enhances survival gameplay by adding balanced and logical recipes for rare or unobtainable items.

Included recipes allow you to:

* Craft a Monster Spawner using rare materials
* Smelt Rotten Flesh into Leather
* Convert Bones into Bone Meal using the Stonecutter
* Craft Gunpowder with renewable ingredients
* Access additional custom recipes

All recipes are designed to feel vanilla-friendly and work seamlessly in both singleplayer and multiplayer worlds.

2. Place it inside your world’s datapacks folder:

```

Supports Minecraft 1.20 and above.
